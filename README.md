Requirements:
- JavaFX
- a JSON library (e.g., `org.json`)
- a SQLite JDBC library

Setup Instructions:
Add the required JAR files to your project structure. Ensure the database is initialized (TestDatabase). 
Start the server by running the Server class in the server package, then run the Main class from the main package (main/com.example.server/Main.java).
By default, the server runs on localhost for testing. To run across multiple computers, start the server on one machine and have clients connect using the server machineâ€™s IP address.
